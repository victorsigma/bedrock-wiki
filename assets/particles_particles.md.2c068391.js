You can create new particle systems in the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft by using your own custom textures, and your own movement logic. This makes particles extremely fun and powerful!</p><p>The Molang integration in particles is also extremely well developed, which allows you to pass data between different particles, or between an entity and a particle.</p><h3 id="particles" tabindex="-1">Particles <a class="header-anchor" href="#particles" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>A &#39;particle&#39;, or a &#39;particle instance&#39; is a single sprite (texture) which is placed in 3D space, and has its own logic for how to move about and change its appearance.

Emitters have their own logic for how to move, how many particles to spawn, and where.
