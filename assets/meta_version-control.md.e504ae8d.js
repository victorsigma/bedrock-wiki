Version control could be achieved at the most basic level by taking a <code>.zip</code> of your addon every day and uploading it to google drive. This isn&#39;t unreasonable, but it has three significant difficulties that proper VCS (version control systems) fix:</p><ul><li>It isn&#39;t easy to compare versions</li><li>It isn&#39;t easy to <em>actually</em> roll-back to a previous version</li><li>It doesn&#39;t do anything to help in team-collaboration</li></ul><p>This tutorial will teach the basics of a tool called <code>git</code>, and a free, online git storage service called `GitHub. Anyone may follow along, but you will receive the most benefit if you are working in a team environment or often lose your work because you forget to back up.</p><p>This tutorial will not be focusing directly on teaching <code>git</code> or <code>GitHub</code>, as outside knowledge sources better do this. The focus will be on setting up these tools for Minecraft once the basics have been learned.</p><h2 id="git" tabindex="-1">Git <a class="header-anchor" href="#git" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p><code>git</code> is a tool installed locally on your machine and allows you to version your files. You can <code>commit</code> changes to your files with a small message (ex. &quot;Fixed issue where dragons couldn&#39;t fly after being tamed&quot;), view the full change-list, and quickly jump back to specific changes.</p><p>Git is insanely powerful and the de-facto tool for all major programming projects. The most significant drawback for MC work is that it is <em>complicated</em>. Be patient while learning.</p><p>For a complete walkthrough of <code>git</code>, you should follow the following <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">git tutorial.</a></p><h2 id="github" tabindex="-1">GitHub <a class="header-anchor" href="#github" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>GitHub is a version of your git project (<code>repository</code>) that is hosted online. This allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time and collaborate. This is very helpful for map-making. By hosting on Github, you can also (optionally) make your code public, making it easier than ever to share your addons with the world.</p><p>For a complete walkthrough of using <code>Github</code>, you should follow this <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">github tutorial</a>.</p><h2 id="vocabulary-quiz" tabindex="-1">Vocabulary Quiz <a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary-quiz" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>If you&#39;ve gotten this far, hopefully, you have a GitHub account and are familiar with <code>git</code> in a small way. The following terms will be used in this tutorial. If you don&#39;t know them, please google \u{1F603}</p><ul><li>repository</li><li>branch</li><li>commit</li><li>github</li><li>git</li></ul><h1 id="setting-up-git" tabindex="-1">Setting up Git <a class="header-anchor" href="#setting-up-git" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h1><p>This assumes you are adding an <em>existing</em> project to git. The steps are similar if you are starting from scratch.</p><h2 id="structure" tabindex="-1">Structure <a class="header-anchor" href="#structure" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The big issue with using <code>git</code> for addons is that <code>git</code> generally works by encapsulating a <em>single</em> folder and managing it. Of course, in Bedrock Addons, assets are spread across two folders: The <code>BP</code>, and <code>RP</code>. To get around this issue, we will place our repository outside of the <code>com.mojang</code> folder entirely and then use window <code>junctions</code> to &quot;copy&quot; the folders in.</p><p>There are many advantages of placing our project in a separate location:</p><ul><li>We can include additional files as needed, such as config files, tools, notes, .bb files, etc</li><li>We can combine the RP and the BP into one repository</li><li>All of our projects can be easily viewed in a simple location, instead of nested deep within com.mojang</li></ul><h2 id="creating-a-git-repository" tabindex="-1">Creating a Git Repository <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-git-repository" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Pick a convenient location for your projects. I placed mine at <code>C:/sirlich/projects</code>. Make a new folder with the name of your map. We will be using <code>wiki</code> as the name of our mock project.</p><p>Right-click the folder, and click <code>&quot;Open git Bash&quot;</code>. If this option doesn&#39;t appear, you can open <code>git bash</code> from the start menu and navigate your project folder. If you don&#39;t have <code>git bash</code> installed, you should do so now.</p><p>Type: <code>git init</code>. This will create a blank repository in your project.</p><h2 id="linking-your-existing-rp-and-bp" tabindex="-1">Linking your existing RP and BP <a class="header-anchor" href="#linking-your-existing-rp-and-bp" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The next step is to make the repository aware of your RP and BP folders. We will be using window symlink &quot;junctions&quot;. When we create a junction, we essentially create a wormhole in our file system that will make it appear like your files are in two places at once. Deleting/editing/adding files is perfectly copied over.</p><p>Type: <code>mklink /J wiki_RP &quot;C:/path/to/RP/in/com/mojang&quot;</code> Type: <code>mklink /J wiki_BP &quot;C:/path/to/BP/in/com/mojang&quot;</code></p><p>When you are finished, you should see <code>wiki_RP</code> and <code>wiki_BP</code> in your project folder, containing all your assets, existing files, etc.</p><p>You can now push this repository to <code>github</code>, following the tutorial above.</p><h2 id="extra-files" tabindex="-1">Extra Files <a class="header-anchor" href="#extra-files" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Because we created our repository based on symlinks, we can add anything we like into the project folder without worrying about breaking the com.mojang folder. I like to track <code>.bb</code> files, cover-art files (<code>.kra</code> etc.).</p><p>You can also add notes, video files, or anything else you want to track.</p><h2 id="working-with-your-vcs" tabindex="-1">Working with your VCS <a class="header-anchor" href="#working-with-your-vcs" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The main things to remember about working with VCS:</p><ul><li>Always <code>pull</code> before starting work</li><li>Commit and <code>push</code> often</li><li>Always <code>push</code> before stopping work</li><li>If you screw up your files super bad, you can always reset to the last working version. If you commit/push often, hopefully, this wasn&#39;t too long ago.</li><li>Always, and I mean <code>always</code> make good commit messages. It&#39;s vital when you have to roll back.</li></ul>',35),n=[r];function l(s,c,d,u,h,p){return i(),o("div",null,n)}const f=e(a,[["render",l]]);export{y as __pageData,f as default};
